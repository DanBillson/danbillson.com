professional:
  - name: Edge Hill University
    year: 2015 - 2018
    body: I completed my degree in Computer Science at Edge Hill University where I studied a wide range of interesting topics including Machine Learning and Embedded Systems. During this time I had also taken on some work alongside a freelance developer and also found out about cheerleading which I went on to compete at the world championship in Florida three times and take home the gold medal.
  - name: The Hut Group
    year: 2018
    body: Straight out of university I had landed myself a role as a graduate front end developer at The Hut Group which is a very large online retailer owning companies such as MyProtein. In this role I was introduced to a variety of different tools and practices that really help a large company function.
  - name: Marmalade
    year: 2019 - 2020
    body: Contrary to The Hut Group, Marmalade has a much smaller dev team meaning that there is much room for advancing technologies, impactful changes and responsibility. As a team we have worked with Gatsby, Lerna monorepos and the latest in React.
  - name: Climb
    year: 2020 - Present
    body: After moving back up north, I joined another small dev team at Climb Creative who are part of the Precision Proco Group, a huge part of printing across the country. With this new line of business came lots of new challenges and exciting projects to work on all with a very hands on approach.

  - title: Should you delay showing the user that something is loading?
    body: So I stumbled across quite a controversial post one day which stated that as a user when you see a loading state, you think the action is taking too long. Most of what we do on the web happens pretty quickly so what is the point in showing a loading spinner for an action that happens almost immediately.
